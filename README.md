# TNala Platform 

This repository contains a prototype version of a platform aimed to make finding and discussing good web resources for language learning easier and more fun.

The platform is still in its early stages. For now, only part of the backend is functional and (partially) tested.

All the code for the backend makes use of the awesome Go programming language [Go](https://golang.org/).

In combination with the lightning fast [fiber](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber) framework,

The prototype makes use of good old reliable Postgres, although the actual platform will use a mix of SQL for relational data and noSQL for metadata
